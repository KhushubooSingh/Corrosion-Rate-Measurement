Corrosion is the gradual degradation of metals due to electrochemical reactions with their environment. In a typical corrosion process, the metal acts as the anode and undergoes oxidation, releasing electrons. These electrons travel through the metal to the cathodic area, where reduction occurs, often involving oxygen or hydrogen ions. The electrolyte facilitates ion movement between anode and cathode, completing the circuit. Factors such as metal type, electrolyte composition, temperature, and exposure time influence the rate and extent of corrosion.
